# Will-Give-In-Good-Hands
This is a charity website, where users can send donations of physical goods to institutions of their choosing.  
Main functionality of this webiste allows for simplified donation process by giving users form with detailed information such as location and time of delivery. This will help institution to receive this delivery.  
Project is realised basing on templates delivered by CodersLab.  
  
## Technologies
In this project I used Hibernate and Spring (Boot, Data, Security) framework.
